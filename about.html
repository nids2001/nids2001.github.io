		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<hr>
		<h4>
		<p>
			My name is Nidhi Patel, I am a second-year student at the University of Utah. I am majoring in Computer Science with a potential minor in Arts Technology. This website is a portfolio page made for my Computer and the Arts course featuring my work during my time at the University.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy taking and editing photos in my free time. As well as listening to music and spending time with my family. I love watching movies &mdash; the good and the cheesy. My all time favorite activity, though, is going on spontaneous hikes and adventures.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you enjoy my work and thank you for taking the time to visit my site!
