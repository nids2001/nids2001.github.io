		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<hr>
		<h4>
		<p>
			My name is Nidhi Patel, I am a senior at the University of Utah. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Arts Technology. This webpage showcase some of the work I have done during my time at the U.
		</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy taking and editing photos in my free time. As well as listening to music and spending time with my family. I love watching movies &mdash; the good, the bad, and the cheesy. My all time favorite activity, though, is going on spontaneous hikes and adventures.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope you enjoy my work and thank you for taking the time to visit my site! Feel free to connect with me on
